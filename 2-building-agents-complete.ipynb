    "1. ✅ **Agents simplify complexity** - A single natural language query handles multiple operations\n",
    "2. ✅ **Combining techniques is powerful** - Query optimization + dynamic filtering = better results\n",
    "3. ✅ **Agents are not magic** - They're structured prompts + smart parsing + API calls\n",
    "4. ✅ **Building blocks are simple** - Each component is straightforward, but together they're powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "**The agent advantage:**\n",
    "- **Before agents**: You'd need to manually write filter code, optimize queries, and chain operations\n",
    "- **With agents**: Natural language → optimized database query with filters automatically\n",
